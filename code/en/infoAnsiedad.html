                <p>
                  Anxiety is an emotion that everyone has experienced at some point and that helps the body prepare to do something important.                
                </p>

                      Anxiety produces a psychophysiological reaction of intense activation of the central nervous system and the entire organism.
                      It appears when you have to act in a situation that demands an intense or sustained effort and serves to activate and deal with a threat or
                      danger that is occurring in the present or that may happen in the future.
                      Therefore, anxiety causes changes in different body systems (activating them) that prepare us to act and help us respond quickly.
                      Anxiety is a normal and healthy reaction in most cases. For example, when facing a job interview or an exam, it can be useful
                      because it puts on "alert". You may notice some physical sensations, such as a faster heart rate or a dry mouth, which decrease over time.
                      the interview or the exam. Even before the interview or the exam you can notice these sensations and have some thoughts like the interviewer
                      it can be very hard or that the questions are very difficult.
                      Keeping in mind that anxiety is a normal emotion is an important aspect for those who have it, since the goal cannot be to eliminate it,
                      but learn to tolerate it and manage it.

                <p>
                  The reactions caused by anxiety have their beginning in the brain mechanisms. The human brain integrates information from the
                   past (memories) with information from the present (situation) to anticipate and foresee the future (consequences).

                    <p class="mb-0 pb-4">
                      The information of the past or memories is formed by the lived experiences linked to the emotions and bodily sensations that were felt in that situation.
                       Remembering the past makes you relive the emotions and sensations that were felt at that time.
                       Thus, some parts of the brain store the information collected from the outside through the sense organs, while others provide the information
                       stored relative to internal emotions and sensations. These various parts of the brain work and activate cooperatively. When a situation of
                       present resembles some previous memory or experience, the same associated sensations and emotions are easily activated. And if this situation looks like
                       to the memory of a situation that made you feel afraid in the past, you can easily evoke it also in the present.

                <p>
                  Anxiety disorders are characterized by intense fear or anxiety and/or excessive worry.
                  These disorders generate significant discomfort and affect the normal functioning of the person regardless of their age.
                  (whether in relation to family or friends, or performance at school or at work).
                  Depending on what the main focus of the fear and/or worry is, we speak of one disorder or another.

                          (such as depression, or problems with the abuse of some substances such as alcohol).</p>

                          people who care for him for fear that something will happen to them and he will never see them again.
                          For example, when a minor gets nervous every time her mother leaves home, even though she stays with her father.
                          He begins to cry and scream and says that something bad could happen to the mother on the street or have an accident.
                          Even so, he agrees to go to school, but they have to take him out of the school cafeteria, and the parents have to be very punctual when they pick him up at the exit.
                          Just hearing about the school colonies makes her cry.</p>

                          If the person has an intense fear of social situations (having a conversation, being observed or acting in front of other people, etc.) it is called
                          anxiety disorder (or social phobia). An example of a specific phobia would be, for example, when a person is afraid of heights,
                          she gets very nervous, trembles and feels dizzy. A case of social anxiety disorder would be when a person feels very nervous
                          when talking to other people. He is afraid of doing something that will make him look ridiculous and that others will think negative things about him.
                          In these situations the person usually turns red and when they realize this they feel even worse.</p>

                          Panic disorder often co-occurs with agoraphobia. This would be the case of a person who notices discomfort and anxiety in situations
                          in which you think that you can faint, when you go on the subway, the bus, in central streets, with many people, which forces you not to take the transport

                          such as taking public transport, going to a concert or a restaurant. This would be the case, for example, of a person who notices a lot of discomfort and anxiety because
                          he thinks that he might pass out when he gets on the subway or the bus forcing him to get off before reaching the stop. In the end he chooses not to take the
                          public transport. He has a similar feeling when he goes shopping or in the city where there are crowds of people.</p>

                          It would be the case of a person who has always been a long-suffering person, who since she was little has been worried about whether her parents were doing well with money or if they would die.
                          And that since he has begun to study ESO, the concerns have increased. Above all, he worries about whether he will be able to pass the course and, also, whether his friends

                      Broadly speaking, when a person has anxiety symptoms, they notice some unpleasant physical sensations such as palpitations or dizziness. This occurs because situations of danger (real or imagined) produce reactions at the brain and hormonal level that activate the body as if they were a fire alarm: when a possible threat is detected, all the person's attention is directed towards this situation to flee from danger and survive.
                      Thus, the person breathes harder (to have more oxygen), the heart beats faster (to get more blood to the muscles and brain and have more glucose and oxygen), the muscles tense (to be more prepared to flee or defend), the pores of the skin close (to protect it from possible injuries), etc. In parallel, alarm information is sent to other glands in the body to release hormones (glucocorticoids) that have an anti-inflammatory effect on tissues and organs, to prevent physical damage. Thus, the body feels like a pressure cooker.
                      Once the danger passes or if it is successful in facing it, or if the person simply realizes that there is no real threat, the alarm at the brain level is deactivated, the nervous system is rebalanced and fear or anxiety anxiety decrease.
                      But it can also happen that, sometimes, it is not known what the specific danger is or where it comes from. The attention then becomes too focused on unpleasant bodily sensations, probably causing the heart and breathing rates to increase further to the point where it becomes difficult to breathe. The increase in these sensations also increases negative thoughts. If all this happens when, for example, you are taking the elevator, it is likely that at some point you decide not to take it anymore (avoidance) or you do it only when they are new elevators or you are accompanied by the immediate environment (safety behavior).
                      In this example, it can be seen how avoidance and the use of safety behaviors (those "tricks" that the person uses to be able to face the feared situations) help the disorder to be maintained, since they do not allow verifying that negative thoughts ( "the elevator will break down and I will have trouble breathing") are not accurate, and the person may think that he or she has been saved by these avoidance or safety behaviors.
                      In certain people, especially if they have been subjected to intense periods of emotional overload and threat in certain periods of development, or if they are vulnerable to anxiety, fear/anxiety responses may appear continuously as a result of a hypersensitization of the alert brain circuits or a slow response in restoring balance once the threat has disappeared.
                      In addition, the repetition of avoidance responses can also affect the normal day-to-day functioning of the person and reduce their freedom and autonomy. It is when anxiety and fear become pathological and make up a disorder. In addition, the frequent activation of the hormonal structures involved can become harmful to the body itself, since the continuous presence of glucocorticoids in the blood can affect the rest of the body's tissues and viscera and generate physical disorders, discomfort or pain in different systems, as well as as well as depression or fatigue.

In the case of children and adolescents, this figure would be around 6 out of 100.
                      The number of people affected also varies depending on the disorder, for example specific phobias are the most common disorder within anxiety disorders.
                      Traditionally, women have been considered to have a higher risk than men of having an anxiety disorder, but the figures vary depending on the disorder in question and age. For example, when talking about social anxiety disorder, the presence between men and women is more even, and in children and adolescents the difference between genders is not as marked as in adulthood.
                      On the other hand, there are several studies that indicate that people with anxiety disorders who do not receive treatment are likely to have a chronification of these disorders and have a higher risk of developing other psychiatric disorders such as depression or excessive consumption of toxic substances. Chronically experiencing anxiety can affect the functioning of the rest of the body's systems and increase the risk of medical illnesses (such as gastrointestinal disorders or heart problems, among others).
                      In terms of age of onset, anxiety disorders are among the earliest onset disorders. The following graph indicates the approximate ages at which the different anxiety disorders usually appear.
